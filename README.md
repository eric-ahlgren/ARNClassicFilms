## App Store
This app is available on the Apple TV App Store. Unfortunately you have to search the store manually. Just search for “classic films” and it should pop up.

## Contribute & Improve
The complete source is available here and you are welcome to contribute to this project. The app is based on standard components like <tt>UICollectionView</tt>, <tt>NSFetchedResultsController</tt> and CoreData. Apple’s CloudKit serves as the backend. You are also free to use this project as an example or to learn tvOS development based on it.
